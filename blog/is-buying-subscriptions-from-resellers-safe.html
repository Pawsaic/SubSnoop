    <h2>Is Buying Subscriptions from Resellers Safe?</h2>
    <p>If you've ever seen offers like <strong>Discord Nitro for $4.99</strong> or <strong>Spotify Premium for $1.29/month</strong>, you might wonder: is this legit? Or too good to be true?</p>

    <h3>✅ The Short Answer: It Depends</h3>
    <p>Not all resellers are shady — many use legal, localized pricing from countries like India, Turkey, or Argentina. As long as they’re not selling cracked accounts or stolen credit cards, it can be a smart way to save.</p>

    <h3>🛑 Red Flags to Watch For</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🔓 Sellers offering login details instead of gift codes</li>
      <li>💳 Asking for direct card payments or crypto only</li>
      <li>🚫 No reviews or presence on Reddit, Trustpilot, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>✅ How to Stay Safe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Use trusted reseller sites like the ones listed on <a href="/">SubSnoop</a></li>
